    "# The Seven Pillars of Statistical Wisdom in Modern AI/ML\n",

    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In his brilliant 2016 book, statistician Stephen M. Stigler identified seven fundamental conceptual shifts that formed the foundation of modern statistics. These weren't just mathematical techniques—they were revolutionary ways of thinking about data, uncertainty, and inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "What's remarkable is that these same principles, formulated in the 18th and 19th centuries, have become the **structural backbone of modern artificial intelligence and machine learning**. While the computational methods have evolved dramatically, the underlying statistical philosophy remains unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates each of Stigler's seven pillars through the lens of contemporary AI/ML, showing both classical statistical implementations and cutting-edge deep learning applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Seven Pillars:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Aggregation** - The wisdom of crowds\n",
    "2. **Information** - The square root law of diminishing returns\n",
    "3. **Likelihood** - Probabilistic inference\n",
    "4. **Intercomparison** - Data validates itself\n",
    "5. **Regression** - Returning to the mean\n",
    "6. **Design** - How you collect matters\n",
    "7. **Residual** - Structure in what's left over\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's explore each one with working code examples."

    "\n",
    "Let's see how **all seven pillars** appear in a single modern system—training a large language model:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **AGGREGATION**\n",
    "- Mixture of Experts architectures (GPT-4, Mixtral)\n",
    "- Multiple attention heads aggregate different representations\n",
    "- Ensemble of models for final deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **INFORMATION**\n",
    "- Scaling laws determine data/compute tradeoffs\n",
    "- Understanding that 10× more data gives only ~2× better performance\n",
    "- Data curation and deduplication to maximize information density\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **LIKELIHOOD**\n",
    "- Cross-entropy loss minimization (next token prediction)\n",
    "- Maximizing likelihood of training data\n",
    "- Softmax converts logits to probability distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **INTERCOMPARISON**\n",
    "- Self-supervised pretraining (no human labels needed!)\n",
    "- Next token prediction: predict from context\n",
    "- Validation sets carved from training data\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. **REGRESSION**\n",
    "- Weight decay (L2 regularization)\n",
    "- Dropout in training\n",
    "- Layer normalization\n",
    "- Early stopping based on validation loss\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. **DESIGN**\n",
    "- Stochastic gradient descent with careful batch sampling\n",
    "- Data shuffling and curriculum strategies\n",
    "- Careful curation of pretraining corpus\n",
    "- Temperature settings in sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7. **RESIDUAL**\n",
    "- Residual connections in every transformer block\n",
    "- Error analysis of model failures\n",
    "- RLHF learns from preference residuals\n",
    "- Iterative refinement based on what model gets wrong\n",

    "### Key Takeaway\n",
    "\n",
    "**These seven pillars aren't separate techniques—they're different facets of the same underlying statistical philosophy that Stigler identified in classical statistics and that we've reinvented in the age of deep learning.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"new\" AI revolution is built on very old statistical wisdom. Understanding these foundations helps us:\n",
    "- Design better models\n",
    "- Diagnose failures more effectively  \n",
    "- Appreciate that modern ML is statistics at scale\n",
    "- Predict what techniques will work and why\n",
